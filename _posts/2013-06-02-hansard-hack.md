This video is about [Hansard Hack](http://2013.hackerspace.govhack.org/?q=groups/hansard-hack), a team project made for Govhack July 2013.

It collates Government transcripts of Hansard data and displays them graphically per politician on the most popular words they use (removing small words like um and or but).

This uses the D3 JavaScript library with added parameters measuring the intent of the word, being positive, negative or neutral and assigning size and colour value to visually show what a politician is about.

**Technology Used:**
