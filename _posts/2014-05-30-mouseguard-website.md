Personal project to create a website to track towns and party movements for a roleplaying game called [Mouseguard](https://mouseguard-map.herokuapp.com/). The customised map from the game can be zoomed in and you can move around. New markers can be dropped and are linked to a form where you can enter details about that location.

**Technology Used:**
 - Ruby on Rails app
 - JS Leaflet for maps
 - Heroku for hosting
