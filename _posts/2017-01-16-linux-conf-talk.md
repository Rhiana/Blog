Gave two presentations on [Mice and Maps](/presentations/#mice-maps) as part of Linux mini conferences, [Katie Conf](https://2017.katieconf.xyz/) and [OS and Games](https://lca2017.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/8/index.html) in Hobart. These focussed on how I built my [Mouse Guard map app](/portfolio/#mouseguard2014) using open source software.
