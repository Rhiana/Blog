Traditional CSS is limiting in a number of ways. While it has many, many attributes, if you want to make something outside the DOM box your options are pretty limited. Leading to many CSS hacks to make objects like, triangles for example, a reality in a modern web browser. This clutters up the HTML and CSS with extra elements it doesn't need. This then slows down performance and makes the code harder to read and maintain. 

This is where CSS Houdini comes in with its DOM magic. It allows you to craft your own CSS attributes using JS Worklets. Making the code more performant, deliberate and reusable. This can also be combined with their new CSS typed system. Which gives you more control over your attributes and useful errors if something goes wrong.
