This video is about Eventable, a team project made for Govhack July 2014.

It allows you to search for events throughout Victoria, as well as how accessible they are and allowing you to add your own accessibility ratings.

This combines information from Victoria Events, the City of Melbourne accessibility information and a crowd sourcing accessibility site [Wheelmap](http://wheelmap.org/en/map)

The duel purpose here being to inform people attending an event if they will be able to access it, i.e. if there is a ramp, lift or accessible toilets. As well as bring this information to the front in order to promote awareness.


The [Melbourne Events](http://www.visitmelbourne.com/Events) website has since been updated with this format, making it easier to search for events which now included accessibility data.
