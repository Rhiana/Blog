I redesigned the Good Games Singles Kiosk. This is a platform where Good Games customers can browse magic card singles to see if they are available in the shop to buy or sell. Previously it was very difficult to see the information and use the site. The new design and layout allows people to browse more easily and is more consistent across the website.
