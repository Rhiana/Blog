This project is about [SVG graphs](https://svg-graphs-on-rails.herokuapp.com/), a personal project made for professional development June 2018.

Previously I had made graphs like this with a javascript library generating the SVG code, however this is impractical on a project where the data constantly changes and the designs are very specific.

Therefore I started making graphs by writing the svg's themselves, linking them up to the existing back end code, just like I would with other front end code.

This library is where I keep my examples of this for reference.
