Worked example on how to make a non standard web component accessible for people with disabilities. I focused on modal pop-up windows as there require many custom aspects including how they are triggered, the focus being placed in a smaller container with the background unavailable and how to keep the keyboard focus local to the modal with an easy way to dismiss the modal. These techniques and principles can be transferred to a number of different custom components.
