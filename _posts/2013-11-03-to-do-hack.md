This project started at a Rails installfest and was worked on during a Rails Camp in November 2013.

The [To Do Homepage](http://rhianashomepage.herokuapp.com/todos) website is a modification of the Ruby starter project of a Blog site. It takes the mantra of "every site is a blog" as I modify the blog entries to be to do items with the new and remove functionality being converted into a single page app.


I added a little bootstrap styling and included alerts when something changed. After the camp I added in a header and tested out a few calendar plugins.

**Technology Used**
 - Ruby on Rails App
 - Hosted on Heroku
 - Styled by Bootstrap
