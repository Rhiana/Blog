No slides or video for this talk as it was given at the last minute as a favour as the organisers were short a speaker for the meet up. This talk focussed on the design and CSS aspects of accessibility, I went into the different types of visual disabilities, including colour blindness which affects 4-5% of the population and people with partial vision loss or tunnel vision.

This then alters how you should be thinking about design, ensuring there is enough colour contrast in your design and with the right colour combinations so that all people will be able to access the information on your website. I also pointed out the trend that while designers often design for on mouse hover, this styling also needs to be applied to on keyboard focus for people with motor impairments who rely on the keyboard for navigation.
