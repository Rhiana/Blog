I implemented a button design with different types of corners to demonstrate CSS Houdini's paint API.It creates a JS paint worklet to draw the background colour on using the 2D canvas rendering objects.

Please note this does not work on all browsers, consult [ishoudinireadyyet.com](https://ishoudinireadyyet.com/).

Technology used:
 - CSS Houdini
   - Paint API
