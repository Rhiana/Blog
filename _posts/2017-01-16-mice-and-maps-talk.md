Walk through on how I made one of my first projects the [Mouse Guard map app](/portfolio/#mouseguard2014). This is a Ruby on Rails app using LeafletJS to control the map. It was designed and built to help run the role playing game Mouse Guard and keep track of events that were happening in the game.
