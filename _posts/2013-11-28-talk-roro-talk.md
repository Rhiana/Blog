Moving from an education background into technology I saw a bit of a skill gap when it came to presenting a technical topic. With the aim of trying to get as much from talks as I could I decided to share some presentation knowledge with the community. Including how to prepare for a talk, what questions to consider, trying to accommodate for the different skill levels and how speaking to a crowd is psychologically different to speaking to an individual or group.
