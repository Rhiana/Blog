This video is about [Going Out Today?](http://goingouttoday.com/), a team project made for Govhack July 2016.

It allows you to search for parks in Victoria as well as the type and number of public restrooms available.

Our goal was to include this information on a map and add additional amenities information such as drinking fountains, walking tracks and dog parks. With the option for people to add in their own features and ratings.

As well as up to date weather information from the BOM with UV ratings and recommendations on what to wear to stay comfortable and sun smart. Everything you need really when planning a trip out.

**Technology used:**
 - Ruby on Rails application
 - React JS
