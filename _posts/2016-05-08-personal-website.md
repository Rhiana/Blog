I started this website in 2016. At that point I had been working for a developer for a few years and had attended a number of conferences, hack days, meet ups and completed some courses. I was starting to lose track so I made this as a way to document my journey.

It has grown over the years with new pages and design revisions. As well as being a good testing ground for having my own site from start to finish.

**Technology used:**
 - [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
 - [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
