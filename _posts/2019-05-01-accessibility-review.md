A service I started with [reinteractive](https://reinteractive.com/) designed to [review websites to see how accessible](/publications/#reinteractive-a11y-review-2019) they are. I go through all of the [WCAG 2.0 checkpoints](https://www.w3.org/TR/2006/WD-WCAG20-20060427/appendixB.html) using a variety of tools to assess if they have passed or failed. If they have failed I give examples and resources to help them fix it up.

**Technology Used:**
 - A11y tools
   - Screen readers
   - Colour contrast checkers
   - Keyboard only
