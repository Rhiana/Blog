This project was completed in March 2014 as part of SheHacks, Australia's first all female hack-a-thon.

The theme of the project was community, [CoffeeHouse Mentor](http://coffee-house-mentor.herokuapp.com/) was set up as a "dating" site for mentee's to look for prospective mentors. Users could login and fill out a profile with their details including background, interests and what they were hoping to get out of this. They would then go to the page showing other people who had signed up and allows you to search or filter responses.

**Technology used:**
 - Ruby on Rails application
 - Hosted on Heroku
