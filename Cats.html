			<h1>Cats have been a wonderful influence in my life.<br> I love seeing them grow from kittens and develop unique personalities.</h1>
			<div class="grid_6 alpha">
				<h2>Harry Heppenstall</h2>
				<p>Here is my favorite cat Harry. We got Harry in 1992 when I was 6 years old as a kitten. I would often dress him up in dolls clothes and push him around in a stroller.</p>

				<h2>Jack the Cat</h2>
				<p>Before him my parents had a cat called Jack. Which is now the name of my little brother. Jack was more of a tom cat and would spend a lot of time away from home chasing lady cats.</p>

				<h2>Arwen Heath</h2>
				<p>After I brought my first home in 2009 my first stop was to the RSPCA to pick up a 2 year old black, almost Burmese, cat I renamed Arwen. She is extremely friendly, as it is her primary defense mechanism, however Arwen is also very adventurous cat and often finds herself getting into trouble!</p>

				<h2>Aragorn Heath</h2>
				<p>A year later in 2010 I returned to the RSPCA and found Aragorn. He was hiding on top of a large structure. After coaxing him down and inspecting his bold patterns his new name became obvious. Unlike Arwen he is a bit skittish, but very sweet when he warms up to you.</p>
