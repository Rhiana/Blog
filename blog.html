			<h3 class="grid_2 alpha">26th of August 2013: Reflection</h3>
			<p class="grid_7 omega first">A few weeks ago I decided to learn how to code. This was not a sudden decision, I have always had an affinity to computers, but a difficult one all the same as it would mean giving up work whilst diving into self-directed teaching of a new and complicated set of skills. My husband was a wealth of resources and enthusiasm and set me up with a number of teaching websites and coding groups to get me started and offering on-going support as needed. However it didn't seem to take me long to grasp the basics of html and css. While it takes a bit of trial and error to make something yourself from scratch, I find it very liberating to be able to read and learn coding. It also makes it easier to follow certain conversation topics that inevitably crop up when you are married to a programmer. Still I believe I have learnt fast, and hopefully well, and look forward to future learning. In particular I will be working on this website, adding features and tweaking code parallel to learning features in order to consolidate my learning.</p>
