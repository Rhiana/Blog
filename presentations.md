    <p>Walk through on how I made one of my first projects the <a href="/portfolio/#mouseguard2014">Mouse Guard map app</a>. This is a Ruby on Rails app using LeafletJS to control the map. It was designed and built to help run the role playing game Mouse Guard and keep track of events that were happening in the game.</p>

    <h3>Pop Up Accessibility</h3>
    <h4>Be Responsive Meet Up         | November 2015</h4>

    <p>Worked example on how to make a non standard web component accessible for people with disabilities. I focused on modal pop-up windows as there require many custom aspects including how they are triggered, the focus being placed in a smaller container with the background unavaliable and how to keep the keyboard focus local to the modal with an easy way to dismiss the modal. These techniques and principles can be transferred to a number of different custom components.</p>

    <h3>Design and colour tips for Accessibility</h3>
    <h4>Melbourne CSS Meet Up | July 2014</h4>
    <p>
      No slides or video for this talk as it was given at the last minute as a favor as the organisers were short a speaker for the meet up. This talk focussed on the design and CSS aspects of accessibility, I went into the different types of visual disabilities, including colour blindness which affects 4-5% of the population and people with partial vision loss or tunnel vision. This then alters how you should be thinking about design, ensuring there is enough colour contrast in your design and with the right colour combinations so that all people will be able to access the information on your website. I also pointed out the trend that while designers often design for on mouse hover, this styling also needs to be applied to on keyboard focus for people with motor impairments who rely on the keyboard for navigation.

    <p>Moving from an education background into technology I saw a bit of a skill gap when it came to presenting a technical topic. With the aim of trying to get as much from talks as I could I decided to share some presentation knowledge with the community. Including how to prepare for a talk, what questions to consider, trying to accomodate for the different skill levels and how speaking to a crowd is psychologically different to speaking to an individual or group.</p>
