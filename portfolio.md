      This video is about Eventable, a team project made for Govhack July 2014.<br>
      It allows you to search for events throughout Victoria, as well as how accessible they are and allowing you to add your own accessibility ratings.<br>
      This combines information from Victoria Events, the City of Melbourne accessibility information and a crowd sourcing accessibility site <a href="http://wheelmap.org/en/map" target="_blank">Wheelmap</a>.<br> 
      The duel purpose here being to inform people attending an event if they will be able to access it, i.e. if there is a ramp, lift or accessible toilets. As well as bring this information to the front in order to promote awareness.<br>
      The <a href="http://www.visitmelbourne.com/Events" target="_blank">Melbourne Events</a> website has since been updated with this format, making it easier to search for events which now included accessibility data.

    <h3>To Do</h3>
    <h4>Ruby Camp</h4>
    <img src="/img/todo.png" alt="to do app">
    <p>This project started at a Rails installfest and was worked on during a Rails Camp in November 2013.</p>
    <p>
      The <a href="http://rhianashomepage.herokuapp.com/todos" target="_blank">To Do Homepage</a> website is a modification of the Ruby starter project of a Blog site. It takes the mantra of "every site is a blog" as I modify the blog entries to be to do items with the new and remove functionality being converted into a single page app.<br>
      I added a litte bootstrap styling and included alerts when something changed. After the camp I added in a header and tested out a few calander plugins.

      This video is about <a href="http://2013.hackerspace.govhack.org/?q=groups/hansard-hack" target="_blank">Hansard Hack</a>, a team project made for Govhack July 2013.<br>
      It collates Government transcripts of Hansard data and displays them graphically per politician on the most popular words they use (removing small words like um and or but).<br>
      This uses the D3 JavaScript library with added parameters measuring the intent of the word, being positive, negative or neutral and assigning size and colour value to visually show what a politician is about.
